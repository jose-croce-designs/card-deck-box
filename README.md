# Spanish-suit card deck box design

This box design is perfect for storing a complete deck of 50 Spanish-suited playing cards (Castillian pattern) in the standard size of 95mm x 62mm.
It's ideal for decks by Heraclio Fournier or similar brands.
The box itself features engraved images of the four suits (coins, clubs, swords, and cups) on its faces.

I printed the model using PETG filament on a Creality 3D-Pro printer with the "50 Naipes" (Spanish for "50 Cards") label facing the build plate for both the box and lid.
I used a 0.4mm extruder nozzle with 0.2mm layer heights, and  no supports or special settings were needed.
This suggests it can be printed on most other FDM printers with similar settings.

I designed the model using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) software and released it under the GNU GPL 3.0 [License](https://github.com/jose-croce-designs/card-deck-box/blob/main/LICENSE).
I found the suit patterns on the followging links from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish-suited_playing_cards) and used them because they're available under a [Public Domain license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain).
